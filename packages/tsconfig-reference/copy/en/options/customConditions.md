display: "Custom Conditions"
oneline: "Conditions to set in addition to the resolver-specific defaults when resolving imports."
---

`--customConditions` takes a list of additional [conditions](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#nested-conditions) that should succeed when TypeScript resolves from an [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) or [`imports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#imports) field of a `package.json`.
These conditions are added to whatever existing conditions a resolver will use by default.

For example, when this field is set in a `tsconfig.json` as so:

```json tsconfig
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es2022",
        "moduleResolution": "bundler",
        "customConditions": ["my-condition"]
    }
}
```

Any time an `exports` or `imports` field is referenced in `package.json`, TypeScript will consider conditions called `my-condition`.

So when importing from a package with the following `package.json`

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "exports": {
        ".": {
            "my-condition": "./foo.mjs",
            "node": "./bar.mjs",
            "import": "./baz.mjs",
            "require": "./biz.mjs"
        }
    }
}
```

TypeScript will try to look for files corresponding to `foo.mjs`.

This field is only valid under the `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` options for [`--moduleResolution`](#moduleResolution).
